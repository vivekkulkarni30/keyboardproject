# 🎹 Keyboard Event Display (Project )

This project demonstrates how to capture and display **keyboard events** using JavaScript.  

## 📌 Features
- Detects any key pressed on the keyboard.  
- Displays the following details in a table format:
  - **Key** → The actual key pressed (e.g., A, Enter, Space).  
  - **KeyCode** → The numeric key code of the pressed key.  
  - **Code** → The physical key identifier on the keyboard.  
- Handles special cases like displaying `"Space"` when the spacebar is pressed.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **HTML** – Page structure  
 # 🎹 Keyboard Event Display (Project 6)

This project demonstrates how to capture and display **keyboard events** using JavaScript.  

## 📌 Features
- Detects any key pressed on the keyboard.  
- Displays the following details in a table format:
  - **Key** → The actual key pressed (e.g., A, Enter, Space).  
  - **KeyCode** → The numeric key code of the pressed key.  
  - **Code** → The physical key identifier on the keyboard.  
- Handles special cases like displaying `"Space"` when the spacebar is pressed.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **HTML** – Page structure  
- **CSS** – Styling (optional)  
- **JavaScript** – Event handling & DOM manipulation  

## 🚀 How It Works
1. User presses any key.  
2. The `keydown` event is captured by JavaScript.  
3. The key details are dynamically inserted into a table on the webpage.  

## 📷 Example Output
| Key   | KeyCode | Code   |
|-------|---------|--------|
| A     | 65      | KeyA   |
| Space | 32      | Space  |
